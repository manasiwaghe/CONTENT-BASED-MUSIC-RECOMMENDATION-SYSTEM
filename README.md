#Project Overview
This project implements a Content-Based Music Recommendation System using the Spotify API. The system provides song recommendations based on the content of a userâ€™s playlist. By analyzing features like genre, tempo, and acoustic properties of the songs in the playlist, the model recommends similar tracks.

#Features
Spotify API Integration: Fetches song metadata from a playlist, including features like tempo, genre, energy, and danceability.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends new songs based on the content and features of songs in a user's playlist.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements machine learning techniques to analyze song features and generate recommendations.

#Tech Stack
Python: Main programming language used for the project.
Spotify API: Used for fetching song features and metadata.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and model building.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
